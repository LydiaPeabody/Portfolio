__Interested in getting a sense of what I can do with data and code?__ <br>

Look in here for a selection of projects demonstrating skills including data preparation, cleaning, visualization, and modelling, as well as web scraping and a use of python packages.  <br>

__Looking for interesting visualizations?__ <br>
Check out projects 2 and 3 from the GA Data Science Immersive course. <br>

__Want an example of start-to-finish project design and develivery?__ <br>
Check out the Capstone-JD-Gender-Analysis project, which combines a wide range of skills including web scraping to generate data, through data cleaning and visualization, to model operationalization on a fully self-directed project.

The working operational model is not yet available online, but will be soon. Reach out if you'd like to see it in the meantime.

Older projects may include clunkier code, lack of modularization, and general weirdness, but they all run and solve a defined problem. I haven't gone back and spruced them up to show my focus on finding a solution that works, and also document how quickly I've been able to increase my facility with data manipulation in python. I enjoy learning new systems (but make sure I know enough to make things work from the start). 

I'm always interested in new projects, and welcome questions and feedback, so feel free to connect with me.
Thanks for your interest!
