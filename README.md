Interested in getting a sense of what I can do with data and code? <br>

Look in here for a selection of projects demonstrating skills including data preparation, cleaning, visualization, and modelling, as well as web scraping and a use of python packages.  <br>

Looking for interesting visualizations? <br>
Check out projects 2 and 3 from the GA Data Science Immersive course. <br>

Want an example of start-to-finish project design and develivery? <br>
Check out the job-description-gender-analysis project, which combines a wide range of these skills.

Older projects may include clunkier code, lack of modularization, and general weirdness, but they all run and solve a defined problem. I haven't gone back and spruced them up to document how quickly I've been able to increase my facility with python, pandas, and data manipulation. 

I'm always interested in new projects, and welcome questions and feedback, so feel free to connect with me.
Thanks for your interest!
